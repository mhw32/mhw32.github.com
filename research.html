      <p class="intro">Helping machines learn faster.</p>
      <p>I'm very excited about the space of machine learning and artificial intelligence. While big data has brought us more data than we can handle, our most novel algorithms still struggle to extract useful information. My research range is wide; currently, I'm interested in the combination of deep nets and Bayesian inference.<p>

              <b>Discrete Switching-State Systems for Intervention and Outcome Predictions: Understanding Vasopressor Administration and Weaning in the ICU</b>
              <p>
              Vasopressor administration is common for controlling
              hypotension in intensive care units (ICUs), and changes
              in timing and dosage can have a large impact on patient
              outcomes. In this work, we use a switching-state autogressive
              model (SSAM) to model the multidimensional
              physiological timeseries of patients before, during, and
              after vasopressor administration. Using features derived
              from this SSAM, we achieve state-of-the-art results in
              predicting whether a patient will be administered a vasopressor,
              and the same features can be used to predict
              when a patient can be successfully weaned from the intervention.

              <b>Spreadsheet Probabilistic Programming</b>
              <p>
              Spreadsheet workbook contents are simple programs. Because of this, probabilistic programming techniques can be used to perform Bayesian inversion of spreadsheet computations. What is more, existing execution engines in spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel can be made to do this using only built-in functionality. We demonstrate this by developing a native Excel implementation of both a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo variant and black-box variational inference for spreadsheet probabilistic programming. The resulting engine performs probabilistically coherent inference over spreadsheet computations, notably including spreadsheets that include user-defined black-box functions.

              <p>
              Cosmological simulations allow for visualizing the Universe under varying assumptions, and quantifying the differences in the resulting large-scale structure due, for example, to its spatial complexity. Employing the topological and geometric features of the large-scale structure, hypothesis tests are developed using persistent homology.

              <p>
              Given financial data from popular sites like Yahoo and the London Exchange, the presented paper attempts to model and predict stocks that can be considered "good investments". Stocks are characterized by 125 features ranging from gross domestic product to EDIBTA, and are labeled by discrepancies between stock and market price returns. An artificial neural network (Self-Organizing Map) is fitted to train on more than a million data points to predict "good investments" given testing stocks from 2013 and after.

              <b>Edge-based Crowd Detection from Single Image Datasets</b>
              <p>
              This paper describes the design of a crowd-based facial detection and recognition system using only optical features, allowing for robustness in tracking characterizations with applications in security and data extraction. Implementation is divided into three parts: packing information regarding a given image into edge pixels, segmentation into object groups, and circular segmentation. Detection is achieved by filtering the circles and characterizing those with features similar to that of a normal face. Preliminary facial recognition is described by matching feature vectors to each facial region and matching over subsequence image frames. Algorithms were implemented in MATLAB and testing was performed with a low-resolution video camera. Through a number of trials, results show good detection and tracking abilities given small to medium crowd sizes. Several limitations will be addressed.

              <b>Autonomous Mapping and Navigation through Utilization of Edge-based Optical Flow and Time-to-Collision</b>
              <p>
              This paper proposes a cost-effective approach to map and navigate an area with only the means of a single, low resolution camera on a "smart robot", avoiding the cost and unreliability of radar/sonar systems. Implementation is divided into three main parts: object detection, autonomous movement, and mapping by spiraling inwards and using the A* Path finding algorithm. Object detection is obtained by editing Horn-Schunck's optical flow algorithm to track pixel brightness factors to subsequent frames, producing outward vectors. These vectors are then focused on the objects using Sobel edge detection. Autonomous movement is achieved by finding the focus of expansion from those vectors and calculating time to collision which are then used to maneuver. Algorithms are programmed in MATLAB and implemented with LEGO Mindstorm NXT 2.0 robot for real-time testing with a low-resolution video camera. Through numerous trials and diversity of the situations, validity of results is ensured to autonomously navigate and map a room using solely optical inputs.

              <b>Position and Vector Detection of Blind Spot motion with the Horn-Schunck Optical Flow</b>
              <p>
              The proposed method uses live image footage which, based on calculations of pixel motion, decides whether or not an object is in the blind-spot. If found, the driver is notified by a sensory light or noise built into the vehicle's CPU. The new technology incorporates optical vectors and flow fields rather than expensive radar-waves, creating cheaper detection systems that retain the needed accuracy while adapting to the current processor speeds.
